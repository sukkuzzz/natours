// 1) Global Middlewares:-
// Implement CORS
// What is CORS, And why we need to implement it?
// Now let's say some other website is trying to access our api, it won't be able to because by default cross origin requests are not allowed
// So using cors, we can allow other origins to access our apps api
// CORS Is basically just a npm package, you can see it's code yourself
// It basically sets Access-Control-Allow-Origin *(To every request)
app.use(cors());
// If we just want to apply cors to a specific api, we could have simple done this app.use('/api/v1/tours', cors(), tourRouter);

// Important:- Now this simple cors() works only for simple request like get, post
// For non simple requests like put, patch, delete, browser first gives a options request to confirm that the request like delete is safe to send or not
// So we need to send Access-Control-Allow-Origin * in the header with the response to options request to let browser knwo cross origin is allowed for delete
// Options is just like other http methods
app.options("*", cors());

// Serving Static files
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, "public")));

// Set Security HTTP headers
app.use(helmet({ contentSecurityPolicy: false }));

// Development logging
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "development") {
  app.use(morgan("dev"));
}

// This will allow only 100 request in an hour from an IP
const limiter = rateLimit({
  max: 100,
  windowMs: 60 * 60 * 1000,
  message: "Too many requests from this IP, please try again in an hour!",
});
app.use("/api", limiter);

// Important:- Now in production when the chekout session is completed(See booking controller getCheckoutSession) the weebhooks we integrated in stripe will automatically send a post request to the /webhook-checkout url when the checkout is completed. The /webhook-checkout is defined in app.js route itself which will then call the webhookCheckout below to create a booking
// Route to handle the posted session data from stripe after the payment is done
// Stripe webhook url is implemented BEFORE body-parser, because stripe needs the body as stream(in raw form)
// IMPORTANT:- This is the reason this route is implementd here and not in booking routes
app.post(
  "/webhook-checkout",
  // We need to parse the body into the raw format to req.body here for stripe to implement the constructevent function in webhookCheckout in booking controller
  express.raw({ type: "application/json" }),
  bookingController.webhookCheckout
);

// As soon as the body hits this middleware it will be converted to simple json and it will then be put on req.body as a simple json object
// Body parser, reading data from body to req.body
// When we have a data larger than 10kb it will not be accepted in our body
app.use(express.json({ limit: "10kb" }));
// Parses the data from cookies
app.use(cookieParser());

// Data sanitization from req.body to prevent malicious data(against NoSQL query injection)
app.use(mongoSanitizer());

// Data sanitization against XSS
app.use(xss());

// Prevent parameter pollution
app.use(
  hpp({
    whitelist: [
      "duration",
      "ratingsQuantity",
      "ratingsAverage",
      "maxGroupSize",
      "difficulty",
      "price",
    ],
  })
);

// This is going to compress all the text sent to client
app.use(compression());

// 2.) Test middleware
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  req.requestTime = new Date().toISOString();
  // console.log(req.cookies)
  next();
});

// 3.) Routes:-
app.use("/", viewRouter);

app.use("/api/v1/tours", tourRouter);
app.use("/api/v1/users", userRouter);
app.use("/api/v1/reviews", reviewRouter);
app.use("/api/v1/bookings", bookingRouter);

app.all("*", (req, res, next) => {
  next(new AppError(`Can't find ${req.originalUrl} on this server!`, 404));
});

app.use(gloabalErrorHandler);
